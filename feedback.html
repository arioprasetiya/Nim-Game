Good!


<h4>Structure and Approach</h4>

at the appropriate locations, choice of parameters to methods.

<i>Deductions</i>
<br>
Some subset of the following lines will be selected by the marker. Deduct 0.5 marks <b>any error listed below</b> or deduct marks specified for particular issues.
<p><ul>

<li>duplicate code segments: The game-play process code for two players are duplicated, consider replacing them with methods. (-0.5)
<!-- <li>main method too long or too complex;
<li>other methods too long or too complex;
<li>insufficient use of methods;
<li>overly complex algorithmic approach;
<li>unnecessary duplication/copying of data;
<li>overly complex method argument lists;
<li>avoidance of non-static instance variables/methods, -1.0 mark; <b>(Please give detailed suggestions for improvement if deducting under these -1.0/-2.0 items)</b>
<li>avoidance of private instance variables/methods, -1.0 mark;
<li>not using try/catch to handle Exceptions, -1.0 mark;
<li>AI player has been implemented without making use of inheritance/polymorphism 
(use if-else to test player type in game-play), -2.0 marks; 
<li>other structural issue, if major then deduct 1 mark; -->
<li>other structural issue, if major then deduct 1 mark: Should use more specific/detailed exceptions. Either Java built-in exception (e.g. "ArrayOutOfBoundException") or customized exception (e.g. "InvalidCommandException") are fine.

<b><i>Bonus</i></b>
<p>
Bonus is worth <b>1.5 marks</b>.
<p>



<p>In each test, there are three sub-tests. For each sub-test, if winning ratio under BONUS TASK <b>or</b> BONUS TASK VISIBLE TEST is 100%, we will award the 0.5 mark. </p>

<li>Wining ratio is 100% if moves first, against dummy rival player, +0.5
<li>Wining ratio is 100% if moves first, against oracle rival player, +0.5
<li>Wining ratio is 100% if moves second, against dummy rival player, +0.5
