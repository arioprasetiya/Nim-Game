# Nim-Game
This is one of my first coding project assignment for my class during my masters in Information Technology in 2018. 

It's a nim game with simple ai, and can be played with 2 player with turn based system. I learned a lot from making this game.

This is actually part 3 and the last part of the assignment. We start simple from just playing the game of nim initially and expands into adding functions, command input, able to save the game into text, read from the text, streamable input

It's built using Java, standard library only.
What I learned from building this:
- Object Oriented Programming
- Streamable input I/O
- Instances
- Comparator between objects and instances

This thing is not perfect have a lot of flaws, I learned from others too building this thing and suffers from it
It's my first attempt to dive into the world of programming, it's a bit late upload, the files are old but it's my first major programming build assignment and I'm suffering from trauma doing it (jk)

This acts as a foundation for me to learn other programming language as I'm currently wants to focus more on C#. I was planning to refactor this code but I'm a bit too lazy to do it. Maybe I just give chatGPT my code, it can do better

"If its already works, don't touch it again"
